                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>
                    I am a diligent and reliable worker currently enrolled in the University of North Carolina's Fullstack Web Development bootcamp.
                    I have been actively working on getting my degree in engineering at Wake Technical Community College. Through my current job, I have 
                    created an engaging and educational environment for the children that I care for. This has required substantial time management skills
                    as well as the ability to make decisions efficiently. I have aimed for a jack of all trades mentality so as 
                    to bring the best version of myself to my career.
